This will tell you the steps to deploying the Adilla server.

* Make sure that you have Ruby installed on the machine (should come by
  default on EC2 Linux images).  If not:
  sudo yum install ruby rdoc
* Install the gem package manager and ruby on rails.  See:
  http://rubyonrails.org/download
* Install MySQL, then install the MySQL gem by running:
  sudo gem install mysql
* Install the Amazon AWS S3 gem (see "Required Ruby Gems.txt" in this directory).
* Clone the Adilla Server Rails app from GitHub.
  1. Generate an SSH key if one doesn't exist:
     http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/
  2. Add the deployment key to GitHub through admin settings.
* Set up Amazon S3 (see "Amazon-S3/Setting up S3.txt")
* CD into the Adilla directory and run the Rails server by executing 
    ruby script/server
