This will tell you what you need to do to set up Adilla to work with Amazon S3.

* Create a bucket for the environment you are deploying.  Current bucket names are:
	Development -- dl.dev.adil.la
	Testing -- dl.test.adil.la
	Production -- dl.adil.la
* Ensure your buckets have the "list" property disabled so that public users cannot
  see a list of the bucket's contents.
* Place Robots.txt in the root directory of the bucket.
* Create CNAME entries in DNS for each S3 bucket on adil.la:
	Host Name		Record Type		Value
	dl.dev			CNAME			s3.amazonaws.com.
	dl.test			CNAME			s3.amazonaws.com.
	dl  			CNAME			s3.amazonaws.com.
	(Yes, that's s3.amazonaws.com., with a period at the end.)
